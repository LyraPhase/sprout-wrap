# NOTE: This is a Fork üç¥‚ö†Ô∏è üî±

This project uses [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) and [librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef)
to run a custom set of the recipes in sprout-wrap's cookbooks.

Additionally, it adds the [`lyraphase_workstation`](https://github.com/trinitronx/lyraphase_workstation) cookbook for installing a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), and miscellaneous audio and development tools.

## Sponsor

## Prerequisites

## Installation on macOS

### The Easy Way üöÄ

#### 1. Run bootstrap script

Open a terminal and run:

    \curl -Ls https://git.io/Jy0EQ | bash

Alternatively, run:

    git clone https://github.com/LyraPhase/sprout-wrap.git
    cd sprout-wrap
    make bootstrap

### The Semi-Manual Way üí™

#### 1. Install Command Line Tools

[Download](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/) and install XCode or the XCode command line tools.

    xcode-select --install

#### Installation

To provision your machine, open up Terminal and enter the following:

    sudo xcodebuild -license
    xcode-select --install
    git clone https://github.com/LyraPhase/sprout-wrap.git
    cd sprout-wrap

#### 2. Ruby Installation

##### Install RVM

    bash -c "./bootstrap-scripts/bootstrap-rvm.sh $USER"
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin"
    [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*
    sprout_ruby_version=$(tr -d '\n' < "${REPO_BASE}/.ruby-version")
    sprout_ruby_gemset=$(tr -d '\n' < "${REPO_BASE}/.ruby-gemset")
    sprout_rubygems_ver=$(tr -d '\n' < "${REPO_BASE}/.rubygems-version") ## Passed to gem update --system
    sprout_bundler_ver=$(grep -A 1 "BUNDLED WITH" Gemfile.lock | tail -n 1 | tr -d '[:blank:]')

##### Install Ruby

    # Install Ruby, Create Gemset and install Bundler + RubyGems
    ## NOTE: You might need to set compilation options for native gem extensions (e.g.: libffi, nokogiri)
    rvm install "ruby-${sprout_ruby_version}"
    rvm use "ruby-${sprout_ruby_version}"
    rvm gemset create "$sprout_ruby_gemset"
    rvm use "ruby-${sprout_ruby_version}"@"${sprout_ruby_gemset}"
    rvm "${sprout_ruby_version}" do gem update --system "${sprout_rubygems_ver}"
    rvm "${sprout_ruby_version}" do gem install --default "bundler:${sprout_bundler_ver}"
    if ! bundle list | grep -q "bundler.*${sprout_bundler_ver}"; then
      bundle exec gem install --default "bundler:${sprout_bundler_ver}"
    fi
    bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle' ;
    bundle config set --local without 'development' ;
    bundle install

    caffeinate ./sprout

The `caffeinate` command will keep your computer awake while installing; depending on your network connection, `soloistrc`, and `run_list`, soloist can take from 10 minutes to 2 hours to complete.

## Problems?

### ObjectiveC Fork Error

As of macOS `10.14`, the [behavior of underlying ObjectiveC macOS Foundation framework changed][objc-fork-mojave]. (Big surprise, Apple changes fundamental development platform dependencies so often it causes many things to break üçéüí©)
This results in the following errors:

    objc[37813]: +[__NSPlaceholderDictionary initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.
    objc[37813]: +[__NSPlaceholderDictionary initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.
    [2020-07-20T16:25:31-06:00] FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::ChildConvergeError: Chef run process terminated by signal 6 (IOT)
    [2020-07-20T16:25:31-06:00] FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::ChildConvergeError: Chef run process terminated by signal 6 (IOT)

The workaround is to run `soloist` / `chef-solo` with the following environment variable:

    export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
    bundle exec soloist run_recipe homebrew::install_casks ## For example

### clang error

If you receive errors like this:

    clang: error: unknown argument: '-multiply_definedsuppress'

then try downgrading those errors like this:

    sudo ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future bundle

### Command Line Tool Update Server

If you receive a message about the update server being unavailable and are on Mavericks, then you already have the command line tools.

## Customization

This project uses [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) and [librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef)
to run a subset of the recipes in sprout's cookbooks.

[Fork it](https://github.com/LyraPhase/sprout-wrap/fork) to customize its [attributes](http://docs.chef.io/attributes.html) in [soloistrc](/soloistrc) and the list of recipes
you'd like to use for your team. You may also want to add other cookbooks to its [Cheffile](/Cheffile), perhaps one
of the many [community cookbooks](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks). By default it configures an macOS workstation for development and as a Digital Audio Workstation environment.

Finally, if you've never used Chef before - we highly recommend you buy &amp; watch [this excellent 17 minute screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/339-chef-solo-basics) by Ryan Bates.

## Caveats

### Homebrew

- Homebrew path prefix [has changed](https://github.com/Homebrew/discussions/discussions/417) on Apple Silicon to `/opt/homebrew`.  You may encounter issues after migrating from an Intel Mac unless running under Rosetta `Terminal.app`.  Fresh installs on `arm64` based hardware will use the new location and compile natively for Apple Silicon.
- Homebrew cask has been [integrated](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/pull/15381) with Homebrew proper. If you are experiencing problems installing casks and
  have an older installation of Homebrew, running `brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update` should fix things.
- If you are updating from an older version of `sprout-wrap`, your homebrew configuration in `soloistrc` might be under `node_attributes.sprout.homebrew.formulae`
  and `node_attributes.sprout.homebrew.casks`. These will need to be updated to `node_attributes.homebrew.formulas` (note the change from formulae to formulas)
  and `node_attributes.homebrew.casks`.

## Development Tips & Tricks

Some helpful commands and tricks to know when working on this repo:

1. To run `bootstrap.sh` with a custom `soloistrc`:

        export SOLOISTRC='soloistrc.lyra'

2. To test `bootstrap.sh` `curl` piped to `bash` mode on a development branch (with `set -x` trace mode):

        export SPROUT_WRAP_BRANCH=my-feature-branch
        export SOLOISTRC=soloistrc.my-feature-test
        \curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LyraPhase/sprout-wrap/${SPROUT_WRAP_BRANCH}/bootstrap-scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash -x

3. To replicate what `bootstrap` CI workflow does:

        export CI=true
        # Ensure you have same Ruby + RubyGems + Bundler versions
        bundle install
        bundle exec make bootstrap

4. To replicate what `test` CI workflow does:

        export CI=true
        # Ensure you have same Ruby + RubyGems + Bundler versions
        bundle install
        bundle exec make test
