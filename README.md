# sprout-wrap

[![ci](https://github.com/LyraPhase/sprout-wrap/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LyraPhase/sprout-wrap/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

# NOTE: This is a Fork!

This project uses [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) and [librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef)
to run a custom set of the recipes in sprout-wrap's cookbooks.

Additionally, it adds the [`lyraphase_workstation`](https://github.com/trinitronx/lyraphase_workstation) cookbook for installing a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), and miscellaneous audio and development tools.

## Prerequisites


## Installation under Mavericks (OS X 10.9)

### The Easy Way:

#### 1. Run bootstrap script

Open a terminal and run:

    \curl -Ls https://git.io/viaJe | bash

### The Semi-Manual Way:

### 1. Install Command Line Tools

[Download](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/) and install XCode or the XCode command line tools.
  
    xcode-select --install

## Installation

To provision your machine, open up Terminal and enter the following:

```sh
sudo xcodebuild -license
xcode-select --install
git clone https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap.git
cd sprout-wrap
caffeinate ./sprout
```

The `caffeinate` command will keep your computer awake while installing; depending on your network connection, soloist can take from 10 minutes to 2 hours to complete.

## Problems?

### ObjectiveC Fork Error

As of macOS `10.14`, the [behavior of underlying ObjectiveC macOS Foundation framework changed][objc-fork-mojave]. (Big surprise, Apple changes fundamental development platform dependencies so often it causes many things to break üçéüí©)
This results in the following errors:

    objc[37813]: +[__NSPlaceholderDictionary initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.
    objc[37813]: +[__NSPlaceholderDictionary initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.
    [2020-07-20T16:25:31-06:00] FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::ChildConvergeError: Chef run process terminated by signal 6 (IOT)
    [2020-07-20T16:25:31-06:00] FATAL: Chef::Exceptions::ChildConvergeError: Chef run process terminated by signal 6 (IOT)

The workaround is to run `soloist` / `chef-solo` with the following environment variable:

    export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
    bundle exec soloist run_recipe homebrew::install_casks ## For example

### clang error

If you receive errors like this:

    clang: error: unknown argument: '-multiply_definedsuppress'

then try downgrading those errors like this:

    sudo ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future bundle

### Command Line Tool Update Server

If you receive a message about the update server being unavailable and are on Mavericks, then you already have the command line tools.

## Customization

This project uses [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) and [librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef)
to run a subset of the recipes in sprout's cookbooks.

[Fork it](https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap/fork) to 
customize its [attributes](http://docs.chef.io/attributes.html) in [soloistrc](/soloistrc) and the list of recipes 
you'd like to use for your team. You may also want to add other cookbooks to its [Cheffile](/Cheffile), perhaps one 
of the many [community cookbooks](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks). By default it configures an OS X 
Mavericks workstation for Ruby development.

Finally, if you've never used Chef before - we highly recommend you buy &amp; watch [this excellent 17 minute screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/339-chef-solo-basics) by Ryan Bates. 

## Caveats

### Homebrew

- Homebrew cask has been [integrated](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/pull/15381) with Homebrew proper. If you are experiencing problems installing casks and
  have an older installation of Homebrew, running `brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update` should fix things.
- If you are updating from an older version of sprout-wrap, your homebrew configuration in soloistrc might be under `node_attributes.sprout.homebrew.formulae`
  and `node_attributes.sprout.homebrew.casks`. These will need to be updated to `node_attributes.homebrew.formulas` (note the change from formulae to formulas)
  and `node_attributes.homebrew.casks`.
